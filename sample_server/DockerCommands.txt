 Go to the directory that has your Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image.
 The -t flag lets you tag your image so it's easier to find later using the docker images command:
 docker build . -t rafiriyazahmed/testimage

 docker images

 Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode,
 leaving the container running in the background.
 The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container.
 Run the image you previously built:

 docker run -p 4000:3000 -d rafiriyazahmed/testimage

# Get container ID
$ docker ps

# Print app output
$ docker logs <container id>


If you need to go inside the container you can use the exec command:
# Enter the container

$ docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash

To stop the container
docker stop 26bff720a26b
